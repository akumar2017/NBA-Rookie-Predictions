# NBA Rookie Predictions

by Akash Kumar (ajk279) and Pranav Darbha (pd353)

Research Question: Can we predict the performance of the 2019 NBA Rookie Class using advanced statistics (Win Shares, Box Plus Minus, Player Efficiency Rating etc) and physical metrics?

In the annual NBA Draft, 60 players from American universities and other leagues around the world are chosen in the hope that they can be strong players in the world's most competitive basketball league. Many more are signed as undrafted free agents. For each pick, teams spend thousands of hours scouting prospects, hoping that they can find the player with the right fit who will succeed in their team's environment. This often involves scouts watching them play live and watching film to analyze their tendencies and style of play.

With the plethora of college and NBA data available for draft classes throughout the years, we hope to be able to predict the performance of 2019 Rookies. We plan on using datasets from www.basketball-reference.com and www.sports-reference.com/cbb from 2006-2019 (starting with the implementation of the "one and done" rule which prevented high school players from entering the NBA draft). We want to focus on using advanced statistics that analyze a player's overall performance rather than relying on traditional metrics like points, rebounds and assists. We hope that we can predict their performance in the NBA as measured by the same advanced statistics. We also hope to discover which advanced statistics are most effective at predicting performance. Once a model is built, we can evaluate its performance by looking at the stats of 2019 Rookies in the NBA as the season begins on October 4th.
